Setup the TYPO3 installation
============================

.. _setup-typo3-git-clone:
.. _git-clone:

git clone
=========

Switch into your **empty** htdocs directory of choice and clone a fresh master of TYPO3:: 

   git clone git://git.typo3.org/Packages/TYPO3.CMS.git .

.. _git-guis:

git GUIs
========

If you rather like to work with your favorite Git GUI, we compiled a list of the ones used throughout the core team
here.

* :ref:`SourceTree on Windows<windows-clonewithsourcetree>`
* SourceTree on OSX
* :ref:`Git Tower on OSX<gittower-osx>`
* `GitKraken <https://www.gitkraken.com>`__

.. _composer-install:

composer install
================

Run composer install in the same directory you cloned the master repository to.
This may take several minutes::

   # cd <cloned project>
   composer install

.. _yarn-build:

yarn install
============

.. important::
   Make sure you have version 8 (LTS) of Node.js installed.

Go to the `Build` folder of your TYPO3 install root directory.
Install all dependencies with `yarn install`.
Wait for the the end of the install progress.
Type `yarn build` for the build process.

::

   cd Build
   yarn install
   yarn build
   cd ..


.. _yarn-tasks:

yarn tasks
----------

The following is a list of available build targets (see package.json for an
up-to-date list). You will only be needing these if you want to do something
specific. Usually, it should suffice to use `yarn install` and `yarn build`.

-   `yarn build` - Compile everything.
-   `yarn build-css` - Compile SCSS to CSS.
-   `yarn lint` -  Test your SCSS and ts files.
-   `yarn build-js` - Compile JavaScript.
-   `yarn format` - Resolve Style issues.
-   `yarn update` - Update dependencies (Use this if you are **really** sure what you're doing).

.. _setup-typo3-installation:

Setting up a working TYPO3 installation
=======================================

You will now need to use your git clone to setup a working installation
of TYPO3. There are many different ways how you can do this. We will
provide a few examples in the Appendix:

* :ref:`ddev`
* :ref:`setting-up-typo3-manually`
